jobscheduler
============

Python based portable, scalable job scheduler with multiple priorities - for ANSYS CFX
This is a project in progress, with the goal of becoming a multi-platform job scheduler for ANSYS CFX that has a balance between sophistication and ease of deployment. Current job schedulers are relatively very sophisticated and complex to setup with several pre-requisites. As of now, this program is ideally suited for individuals and small teams, with 1-3 computing clusters working in tandem.

See the Wiki for the project goals, algorithm and other details.
